### Example 1: Ref:rain by Aimer (Kanji & English)

<original>
[Verse 1]
Raining 夏の午後に 通り雨 傘の下
Kissing 濡れた頬に そっと口づけた
あの季節に まだ焦がれている

[Verse 2]
Miss you 窓の外に 遠ざかる景色たち
Breezing 虹が見えた すぐに消えそうで
雨 明日は降らなければいい

[Pre-Chorus]
何も手につかずに 上の空の日々
Nothing but you're the part of me

[Chorus]
まだ 足りなくて
まだ 消えなくて
重ねた手のひらから幼さが
What a good thing we lose?
What a bad thing we knew
そんなフレーズに濡れてく 雨の中

ただ 足りなくて
まだ 言えなくて
数えた日の夢からさよならが
What a good thing we lose?
What a bad thing we knew
触れられずにいれたら 笑えたかな?

[Verse 3]
Calling 白い息が 舞いあがる 空の下
Freezing 強い風に 少しかじかんだ手と
弱さをポケットの中に

[Pre-Chorus]
どこを見渡しても 通り過ぎた日々
Nothing but you're the part of me

[Chorus]
また 触れたくて
ただ 眩しくて
思わず目をそらした優しさに
I wanna sleep in your feel
I wanna see you in the deep
そんなフレーズを並べた詩を 今

あの帰り道 バスに揺られて
叶うはずもない様な夢を見た
I wanna sleep in your feel
I wanna see you in the deep
繰りかえす季節に 慣れないまま

[Bridge]
もう少しくらい大人でいれたら 何て言えただろう?

[Chorus]
まだ 足りなくて
まだ 消えなくて
重ねた手のひらから幼さが
What a good thing we lose?
What a bad thing we knew
そんなフレーズに濡れてく 雨の中

ただ 足りなくて
まだ 言えなくて
数えた日の夢からさよならが
What a good thing we lose?
What a bad thing we knew
触れられずにいれたら 笑えたかな?

[Verse 1]
Raining... Under the umbrella one summer afternoon as a shower passed,
Kissing... I gently kissed your wet cheek.
I'm still longing for that season.

[Verse 2]
Miss You... The scenes outside my window grow distant.
Breezing... I saw a rainbow just barely vanishing.
I just hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm at a total loss these days, with my head in the clouds.
Nothing but you're the part of me

[Chorus]
It's still not enough.
It still won't fade away.
Innocence remains in the palms of our joined hands.
What a good thing we lose?
What a bad thing we knew
These phrases soak through me like rain.

It's still not enough.
I still can't say
The "goodbye" from my dreams, back when I was counting the days.
What a good thing we lose?
What a bad thing we knew
If we had never touched, would we be smiling now?

[Verse 3]
Calling... Beneath a sky where our white breaths alight.
Freezing... The strong wind chills my hands,
And my weakness, so I hide them away in my pockets.

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter where I look, the days have passed me by.
Nothing but you're the part of me
I want to touch you again.
But you're just too bright.

[Chorus]
I instinctively turn away from the light of your kindness.
Wanna sleep in your feel
Wanna see you in the deep
These phrases form the song I sing now.

I ride that same road home, cradled by the bus.
I see a dream I don't think could ever come true.
Wanna sleep in your feel
Wanna see you in the deep
That season never makes its way back around.

[Bridge]
If I had remained just a bit more mature, I wonder what I could have said...

[Chorus]
It's still not enough.
It still won't fade away.
Innocence remains in the palms of our joined hands.
What a good thing we lose?
What a bad thing we knew
These phrases soak through me like rain.

It's still not enough.
I still can't say
The "goodbye" from my dreams, back when I was counting the days.
What a good thing we lose?
What a bad thing we knew
If we had never touched, would we be smiling now?

<translation>
Among the clouds,
the hazy feelings you hid,
if they could all be blown away —
If I could forget everything,
even the vague feelings I hid, which bloomed in the sky,
that would be nice

The things I see are fully radiant
and shimmer unsteadily, as if they will disappear someday
The things I touch all connect transparently
I wanted to stop them, but they made my head spin

I want to stay here forever
Please, stop time for me

Days where nothing goes well
It’s boring days like those
that you sat here and drew
and I can’t let go of these colours

Uncertain things always
bewitch this helpless me, such that I can’t leave
If I extend my hand, hey
It always feels like I can reach the clouds
and I’m drowning,
drowning

Everything I get a hold of falls out of my hands, even now
There are no pauses to breathe, and it prickles
All I can remember are grey memories
and I could drown in them,
deep, deep down

Just do it already —
take all of me with you and go

Always, and almost helplessly, I can’t let go of the anxious you,
for you are precious to me
If I close my eyes, hey
I always feel as if you’re right beside me
and I’m drowning in this illusion

I’ve realised for a long time now
that today will always never be ‘today’
This summer that belongs only to us
can’t be taken away by anyone
But you were snatched away—

The blinding sunlight was at my back
and you were laughing,
leaning against my shadow
and turning into a blur
Your white dress was swaying
and I held you tight
as light passed through you

I’ll go together with you

In this never-ending summer
In this never-ending summer
